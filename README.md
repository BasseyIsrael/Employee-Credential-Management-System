# **Employee-Credential-Management-System**

This project provides a system for keeping accurate track of the credentials attached to an employee in a man-power driven service providing organization. This system ensures the most suitable employees are always called up for job assignments. It was developed from the need to keep track of eligible personnels when a call up from a contractor is made. The running issue was the downtime experienced whenever the called personnel was found to be ineligible after call-up. This project was developed as a key planning system.

Please, note that the project is still in working progress and the readme file is yet to be fully developed. You can check my other projects [here](https://github.com/BasseyIsrael).
